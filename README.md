# table
Simulator of a table assembly task and testing results

Assuming:
- Your Catkin workspace is in ~/catkin_ws
- Installation of ROS Indigo, Gazebo 2.2 and MoveIt!, as in https://github.com/robosafe/testbench_vhvc_indigo/blob/master/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.txt

To run the tests, run the script table.sh
- Times for launching might need adjusting
- Loop iterations = test numbers, and seeding for parameter initialization (modify as needed)
- Tests to choose from are located in table_simulator/scripts/abstract_tests

If you need access, for research purposes, to our test generators (BDI based and constrained-pseudorandom), please contact us: dejanira.araizaillan@bristol.ac.uk
